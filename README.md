The purpose of this project is build a one stop website for all surf reports that I frequent in the Southern California/San Diego area. Currently, multiple surf report websites (Surfline, Magicseaweed, Solspot, etc.) can provide differing surf reports, especially when it comes to wave height. Instead of visiting these sites individually and trying to consturct the actual wave height in my head based off of how much I trust each site,how well they have reported wave height in the past, and my own personal knowledge, I figured I could use some algorithm to calculate one "Super average" of wave height. The main surf breaks I will be using as a proof of concept are Scripps, Blacks, and Cardiff. These are the breaks I surf the most and am most interested in seeing the results for.

The intended UI is modern and minimal which will allow users to see only the data they came to the site for. This layout is also optimal for translating to a mobile platform in the future as I build this project out more.
